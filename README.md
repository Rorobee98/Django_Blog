# Django_Blog
Welcome to my Django project!

This project aims to create a website designed for users to leave comments and view comments from and by other users. Focusing on the backend, some of the key features of this website demonstrate some utility in user registration, login, and creating a new blog post. 

If you are interested, you can download the repo directly and install the newest version of Django and Python version 3.9 or later to run it.
